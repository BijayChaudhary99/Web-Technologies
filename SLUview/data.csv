ForkingAround M.,5 star rating,"Sep 25, 2025","You really have to be looking for this spot -- it's literally just a pink door with no sign out front, which only adds to its charm. Definitely make reservations; even at 11:30 a.m. when they opened for lunch, the place was already bustling. We started with a half carafe of crisp white wine while my husband enjoyed a local brew. The fritto misto was fresh and perfectly fried -- light, crunchy, and delicious. We followed with a large Caesar salad topped with seared prawns -- the portions were generous and the prawns were huge, tender, and full of flavor. The pasta vongole was equally impressive, loaded with clams and beautifully seasoned. Even though we shared everything, we still left absolutely full and happy. The ambiance is quirky yet cozy, the service impeccable, and James along with the entire waitstaff made us feel so welcome. We absolutely loved everything about this place and can't wait to return!"
Teja K.,4 star rating,"Sep 25, 2025","Only deducting a star because it took almost 3 months to get a seat here, and it wasn't even for a dinner reservation, which would've probably been even harder to get. Located in historic Pike Place, this place is a literal hidden gem, intentionally so, in Post Alley. As the name suggests, the restaurant is behind a literal pink door with no big signs or flashy displays, like a speakeasy. The food was good, slightly expensive which was expected, but reasonable. The lasagna was probably my favorite dish out of all. Sadly I didn't get to try any desserts, but I've heard a lot of good things about them, so I'll definitely be back again to try them. All of the ingredients are sourced locally and are incredibly fresh which really elevate the dishes. I actually think the reason why I loved this place was due to the ambiance. The outdoor patio is exceptional, with flowers and views of the water. I also went in the summer when the weather was good, so that definitely helped. Overall, if you are located in the Seattle area, I'd recommend giving this place a try!"
Ari L.,4 star rating,"Sep 23, 2025",I thought this was going to be a tourist trap.  It wasn't.  Food was quite good.  Pasta was excellent and prices were reasonable.  Lots of seating.  Entryway was a little hard to find but I would rather again in a heartbeat. Get the ragu.  So good.
Rebecca C.,5 star rating,"Novato, CA","A friend of mine recommended dining at The Pink Door while we were visiting Seattle. We didn't have reservations so we took a chance and they were able to accommodate a party of two just before the lunch rush. Our server was very friendly and let us take our time to decide what we wanted to order. For our appetizer we ordered the caprese - pink door. It was a nice and refreshing dish with the tomatoes to start off with. We split the Tuscan fries and Linguini Alle Vongole. They were both outstanding! The linguini had lots of clams and a kick to it with the red pepper flakes. I highly recommend ordering this dish. The fries were delicious and had whole cloves of fried garlic. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and spacious with tall ceilings. I noticed they had some aerial equipment hanging on the wall and a stage. Turns out they have aerial shows. The entrance is not street level and there is no signage outside that says the name of the restaurant. We walked right by it the first time. Overall, the food and service was excellent and I will definitely come back the next time I visit Seattle."
Karen B.,5 star rating,"Sep 17, 2025","Server was excellent, friendly and attentive. Pace was perfect.  Food was amazing, we couldn't decide what to try so we tried a bunch of things!  Bread service was excellent, nice grassy EVOO infused with garlic and rosemary.  Started with the calamari.  So good surprising with shrimp, lemon, olives, calamari was delicious with light aioli.  We shared the clams/mussel dish. So good, Mussels were huge, clams Sweet and salty like eating the ocean.  We saved the bread from the bread service. The grilled ciabatta was good, but we enjoyed the fresh bread more, We also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (thinking about Nona here). The meatballs were not as tender as I like, But the flavor was spot on. So much leftover food, but when you visit Seattle and are not sure you are coming back...brought home a piece of basil cake. Haven't tried it yet, still too full"
David H.,4 star rating,"Sep 10, 2025","One of my favorite Italian restaurants in WA! Vibes are super nice especially if you get a table facing the market. We got the lasagna and linguine this time around, although my all-time favorite item here has been one of their rotational risottos. The linguine is on the menu year round and is also certified broke da mouth! I preferred that over the lasagna, which is what they're known for. If you're wanting to stop by for dinner time, make sure to make rezzies ahead of time bc spots fill up QUICKLY."
Anjelica C.,4 star rating,"Sep 8, 2025","Food - i think they have a rotating menu. so not too many options, but they change often. this was my first time there, so not that i know. this is my knowledge based on reddit. group of 4, we started with the caprese & the calamari. both really good. caprese was very fresh & the calamari had a good crunch and seasoning. the combo was a good idea because we had a little bit of fried & then the caprese to help us feel a little healthy. i had the risotto with corn. basically anything with corn i love. this was really good. the cook on the risotto was also good, not too mushy. service - good. they let us know they changed their bread policy (which you now have to pay for). came in and checked on us. and the food came out quickly. ambiance - i guess they have perfomances but we didn't catch any. otherwise the main dining room was pretty packed. there's also a patio but we didn't check it out. theres quirky paintings on the wall and a trapeze kind of swing. a stage where some (lucky or unlucky) people (based on your personality) had to sit. thankfully not us."
Karen T.,5 star rating,"Sep 18, 2025","Friendly servers, love the moody atmosphere with circusy vibes (they have aerial performers on Tuesday's and jazz on selective days), and delicious pasta! Flavor and texture of the pastas were perfectly made. The sides are just as good to match. Highly recommend this spot."
Arthur E.,5 star rating,"Sep 1, 2025","Went on a Saturday evening - was able to get reservations through Open Table a few days before.  Was seated at the lounge - the ambiance was a bit of a casual, but not super relaxed place.  The lounge has aerial acrobatics shows in the evening time - which was pretty neat. For food, we ordered figs/prosciutto/goat cheese, lasagna, and garganelli.  The antipasto was delicious - figs were super sweet and done right.  The pastas were both very good, but also very rich and heavy - so no need to over-order.  We also had the tiramisu for dessert, which was good - but not amazing.  Also had a bottle of wine to go along with the meal. Overall - a good meal for a special night out without breaking the bank - just make sure to sort out reservations ahead of time."
Steve S.,5 star rating,"Aug 30, 2025","If you've never been, find a way to make a reservation! You arrive at an unassuming ""pink door"" in an alleyway, and it opens up to a beautiful sprawling restaurant with packed tables. The place is bustling with live music, views of the bay, rustic Italian food, and apparently, at times, cabaret and trapeze acts. Already the immersion you get walking down from the entrance is an experience, but then it's quickly backed up by a delicious meal. The ingredients in our starter dishes were palpably fresh and felt locally grown. If you've never had a homegrown tomato, it's a whole other experience, especially when paired in a Caprese salad with freshly made mozzarella. The tuna crudo was also delicious, accompanied by a tangy vinaigrette and little salty accents from the olives and fried capers. From the main dishes, I felt the pappardelle was surprisingly the runaway star. Feel free to let go of any snobbery you have about ordering pasta out when it's handmade like this. Each noodle was rolled so thin that you could practically see through it when held up. So delicate on the palate and accompanied by an earthy ragu sauce that had elements of carrot worked in. Amazing! There is always lots of rave about the Pink Door cioppino (seafood stew) and the lasagna. Unless you're a diehard seafood fan, I would favor a noodle dish over the cioppino, because these people know how to roll out their pasta dough. Overall, landing a reservation in my estimation is challenging but worth the hype. Pro-tip: I found the restaurant opens a set of last-minute tables that you can snag same-day around 11am, so either camp out on the app or set an alert for available tables."
Lea H.,5 star rating,"Aug 30, 2025","This was on my partner's list but we didn't make a reservation. And, we had a bit of an adventure finding it as there is literally just a pink door with a tiny QR code next to it. No open or closed sign or anything. (Hint, it's across the way from a wine bar) We had about an hour wait and they texted us when a table was ready. Our server was polite but engaging and funny. We enjoyed our food but the highlight was the Basil cake which I haven't had before. This one was basil and raspberry with a vanilla frosting. While the meal wasn't cheap, I didn't find it insanely expensive considering the area and economy. My entree which was Linguine Alla Vongole came with easily 2 dozen baby clams. While it was lunch (around 2pm), we were still on NY time and this filled us up for the rest of the day."
Jennifer O.,4 star rating,"Sep 1, 2025","Finally tried The Pink Door in Seattle after hearing sooo many people tell me to go. It's one of the city's most popular Italian restaurants, and it's been on my list forever. I always judge Italian spots by their linguine alle vongole (clams) -- one of my all-time favorite simple pasta dishes. This one was so good: pasta cooked perfectly al dente, a good balance of clams to noodles, and a light white wine sauce with garlic + parsley that brought out the clam flavor beautifully. My boyfriend got the pappardelle al ragù bolognese, which was creamy and flavorful but not super heavy. He loved it. The restaurant itself is kind of tucked away above Pike Place with a nice view -- a little unsuspecting from the outside but really cozy once you're in. Overall: Definitely on the pricier side, but sooo worth it for a date night. I'll be back to try more dishes (and then stroll around Pike Place after)."
Sam M.,5 star rating,"Aug 23, 2025","My boyfriend and I ate dinner at The Pink Door while visiting Seattle for a couple days. We didn't have reservations but I highly recommend making them. Based off what I was seeing online, you need to be about 2-3 weeks out to get a table during peak lunch or dinner times. We ended up going pretty late after a show. We got there about 9:30pm and were seated immediately. They seat until 10pm and are open until 11pm I believe. For us it worked out since we already had evening plans, but I imagine that's too late for most people. Hence the strong recommendation to make a reservation. The ambiance is pretty cool. It's uniquely decorated and everywhere you look you notice something new. They had a stage with live music going until about 10pm. As soon as you walk in the door there is an immediate flight of stairs down, so I'm not sure if they are ADA accessible - If that is important for you, I would call and check if there's an elevator. The food was fantastic in some areas and just ok in others. We started with the Tuscan Fries & Fried Herbs as an appetizer. Absolutely phenomenal fries. As a fry snob, these checked every box for me. The fried herbs and pieces of garlic were divine. For entrees, I got the Northwest Fish of the Day and my boyfriend got the Chicken Piccata. The Fish of the Day was salmon with a sweet onion sauce and seasonal vegetables. It was really good. I was afraid the onion sauce would be too sweet, but it wasn't. My boyfriend thought his piccata was good, but nothing spectacular. He said the sauce was lacking a little in flavor. For dessert we shared the Basil Cake. My boyfriend thought it was just okay, but I loved it! The sweet buttercream pairs so well with the tartness of the raspberry jam. Our server was great. She didn't smile much, but she was very helpful and checked-in frequently. She knew her stuff and was very knowledgeable about the menu. All-in-all, it was a positive experience and I would return."
Jake N.,5 star rating,"Aug 18, 2025","The Pink Door was the best way to end our limited one day in Seattle. Great food and great service located in Pike Place Market it is a definite must do when visiting. For starters we had the Antipasto of the House which was exactly what you'd expect, prosciutto, mozzarella, tapanada, etc. The mozzarella was the highlight for me, when there is enough salt on the mozzarella it's a soft creamy dream. The ciabatta with the olive oil was okay, I quite liked the olive oil served with it but the ciabatta was just average. The chicken picatta was a very standard chicken picatta, but done very well. The sauce wasn't over powering with lemon and the breading on the chicken was nice and light. The polenta cake was very good if you like polenta especially when paired with the sauce. The garganelli was the highlight dish. The pistachios made for such a unique flavor that I'm not used to having in a pasta dish. The nutty saltiness with a light creaminess makes for a fantastic dish. The lasagna is also so unique with having pesto involved. The dish is so rich and creamy it is almost too rich to eat the entire thing. The cioppino was very standard in terms of the seafood involved but the spicy tomato broth plays a big role in adding a lot of flavor to the dish that makes it stand out. One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to and would absolutely go again."
Mi Ae K.,5 star rating,"Aug 14, 2025","The Pink Door From the moment you step through the unmarked pink door in the alley, you know you're in for something special. The vibe is cozy yet lively, with service that's warm and attentive without being overbearing. We started with the bruschetta topped with thick, juicy heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil -- simple but bursting with flavor. The Caesar salad came loaded with crab meat, perfectly crisp romaine, crunchy croutons, and a creamy dressing that wasn't overpowering. For mains, the pappardelle with bolognese was outstanding -- silky fresh pasta coated in a rich, savory sauce -- and the meatballs in marinara were tender, flavorful, and generously portioned. We ended the night with their Housemade Oreo Cookie Gelato Sundae, which is as decadent as it sounds -- creamy gelato, chunks of cookie, and a cloud of whipped cream, paired perfectly with a cup of their rich, freshly brewed coffee. Every dish felt fresh and thoughtfully prepared. This is the kind of place you leave already planning your next visit."
Richard N.,4 star rating,"Sep 11, 2025","Finally got to try The Pink Door, and it was a good experience. Good, but not great, for a restaurant that has a lot of hype. For food, I had the Cioppino, my wife had the risotto, and our party split the Fritto Misto and the Caprese. The Cioppino was good, had a nice variety of seafood. The risotto was cooked perfectly and the added touch of truffle popcorn gave it a great added texture. But the star of the meal was the Caprese. The tomatoes were super fresh and perfect, probably really the best tomatoes I've ever had. Better to make a reservation or go early to avoid a long walk-up wait.  If you happen to have to wait, there's a lot close by that can keep you occupied since it's right in the thick of Pike Place. The ambiance is actually much more casual than I was expecting. There wasn't a dress code, but people tend to be dressed much more business casual than casual. The service was great, and our server was nice, knowledgeable and attentive."
Derek C.,4 star rating,"Aug 6, 2025","The pink door has no exterior just a pink door. Makes it feel like one of those hidden speakeasy.  The environment really has one of those vibes.  They have a daily entertainment show that happens right in the middle of the restaurant.  Sometimes it's a singer, other times it's trapeze artist.  Chill ambiance, no need to dress up.  Perfect for a date night.  Off to the food review 4/5 - Mussels and Clams - These tasted fresh with a heavy amount of garlic.   Only comes with one piece of garlic bread looks like it's for presentation.  Wished there was more, the garlic-y sauce and fresh seafood, you can't go wrong. 3.6/5 - Linguine Alle Vongole - Generous number of clams on the dish with a white wine sauce to sweeten it up.   I'm more into garlic flavor clams than the white reduce wine sauce but to each their own.  Pasta felt very bouncy and fresh.  Expected something to wow me but left slightly underwhelmed. 4.2/5 - Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese - The pasta stands out of this dish.  The flat noodles makes it easy to pick up all the thick ragu sauce.  I didn't expect much from this dish but the sauce has way more depth than I thought.  Very hearty tomato meat flavored dish and it being a surprised welcome really helps it. 3.9/5 - spinich lasangna  - Great dish, very simple with spinach and numerous amount of different cheeses in each layer.  Each bite into the chunk feels like an explosion of flavor in your mouth.  Like other pastas the noodles are very fresh and only highlights the dish further. Overall felt like the place is a bit overhyped for how long it took to get a reservation, but with the show, food, and vibe of the entire place I can see it standing out amongst many other restaurants in Pike Place.   Definitely worth it to check out at least once, but idk if it's a must stop if the wait is longer than 2-3 hours."
Chadie G.,3 star rating,"Jul 30, 2025","It was rather a challenge finding the location but when we found it we were greeted warmly and immediately found ourselves in such a vibe of a place we couldn't resist taking pictures of everything! Impressive service from our waitress.  I love the attention to details, and how enthusiastic she was to explain the menu.  The portions are the perfect size especially when you have a second course to follow after ... we were satisfied and enjoyed the dining experience."
Stephanie W.,4 star rating,"Jul 22, 2025","I REALLY enjoyed the pink door! I was on vacation the week of Independence Day and I had tried to make a res here but nothing was available the Friday we actually stayed in Seattle. I called the restaurant, it's easy to get ahold of someone and they told me that Friday they were closed because it was actually Independence Day. No reservations were available the day prior on Thurs, but they said about half the tables are reserved for walk ins only, so we tried our luck. Thankfully we were able to get a table for 2 on Thurs, and the hosts and waitress were super helpful and attentive! The food was excellent too, and I felt like the portion sizes were a little smaller than what I expected for price, but still totally enough that I was full and very comfortable when I left. Part of what you're paying for is the ambiance too - they have live performers almost every night in summer. There were some jazz musicians there the night we came. Pretty much the only reason I took off a star is parking is a bit nasty imo for such a popular place/area. there was no street parking available when we came and their website mentions the park place garage which is what we ended up doing. The pay kiosk was confusing and I ended up mistakenly thinking I would be charged extra for over 2 hours because of how it was labeled so the end of dinner was rushed. All this aside - I would highly recommend the pink door. It's a little hard to find, but it's absolutely worth it. The mocktail drinks made with alcohol in them were super tasty, and the dessert I had was SUPER unique and delicious! I've eaten at a lot of fancy places and truly I've never had a dessert quite like it and would definitely come back just to have a drink and the biancomangiare (Italian custard/cheesecake-type thing with strawberries) again! Def recommend!"
Dominic O.,5 star rating,"Jul 25, 2025","Tucked away in an alley above the pier, Pink Door is a fairly spacious restaurant focused on italian dishes. However, the true centerpiece of the menu is their clams. We were excited to try these clams but were told that their delivery for the day had yet to arrive. We ordered the bread and tomato appetizer in hopes that delaying our main course would align with the delivery. Fortunately, right as we were transitioning to the main our server shared they had arrived. Fresh off the truck the Clam Linguine and Clam/Mussel entrees were instant hits. We devoured both with fervor and could not get enough of the clam/mussel sauce. Our friends had recommended the spot and we can see why. Will definitely return here in future trips."
Danyelle F.,5 star rating,"Sep 23, 2025","Make a reservation in advance! This place books up fast! We got lucky and called at the right time. We were able to snagged a table after a last-minute cancellation, and I'm so glad we did. The Pink Door is stylish, cozy, and full of charm with its fun artwork and vibrant vibe. The food was just as impressive as the atmosphere. We ordered the Bolognese (amazing), fresh oysters (so yummy), and the squid ink pasta--oh my goodness, SO good! Pair that with their delicious drinks and you've got the perfect night out."
Sarah F.,5 star rating,"Jul 21, 2025","Our experience at Pink Door was great from start to finish! We booked in advance for a Tuesday night and waited about a month for our reservation. We were sat right away and happy to see that there was a live jazz band performing. The atmosphere was fun and lively, even for a week night. As big foodies, we ordered a lot. We started with the seasonal fig and prosciutto appetizer along with the bruschetta. Both were fresh and delicious. We went on to have the seasonal pistachio pasta and the infamous bolognese. I'm not sure we have ever tasted something like the pistachio pasta. It was unique and flavorful and a must have if you are a big pistachio lover. The bolognese was incredible. More of a creamy pink sauce with the most perfect pappardelle noodles. We also got the chicken. Very good but probably wouldn't get it again so I could have more room for the pasta! We finished the meal with house made mint gelato and a classic tiramisu. We loved both! This reservation was well worth the wait and we can't wait to be back to enjoy another meal."
Heather H.,5 star rating,"Sep 3, 2025","The wait was long with no reservations and a long line. Over an hour. But we were prepared for it. Bring water. Take turns for bathroom etc.. Sat in the lounge. Still had tables and a great ambiance. I recommended knowing what you want before sitting down. It can take a while for staff to make the rounds. They won't rush you though. Loved every bite. I'm sure everything they make is delicious. If you can stay later there is entertainment certain nights, like aerial acts or music."

Michael B.,5 star rating,"Sep 2, 2025","This place is legit!  The server was so calm and friendly, with every single interaction pleasant and no mistakes or delays.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I got calamari and chicken piccata, and both were 10/10. The ambiance was romantic, casual, beautiful as we sat outside.  We his might be my favorite restaurant in Seattle - or at least in the top 5."
Ray L.,5 star rating,"Jul 14, 2025","I usually do not care much for pasta, but this place is probably the best lasagna and pasta I have ever tasted. Squid ink noodles - was just ok, this was overhype Scallop - was soooooo good and fresh Lasagna - this is the main dish, we got it as an appetizer, but this was the best!!! Also, this spot is like a speak easy. Its across from a winery in a small hallway. We got lost and almost missed our reservation. - located near pikes market This restaurant would be one of the main reason why i would want to visit seattle again."
Val E.,4 star rating,"Jul 9, 2025","The Pink Door is absolutely worth the hype. I have been wanting to try this place for years but heard from friends that I need a reservation for a month in advance. Apparently you do not! I made a quick call to see if they had any available seating last night (a Tuesday) at 9pm and they had a few tables. We started with the Blue Jean Baby and Chin up! Summer seasonal cocktails. Which were both strong and delicious, then we shared the Tuna crudo appetizer, which was citrusy, savory, and refreshing. I would've ordered 3 more plates of that if it wasn't for the price tag. My friend went for the Chicken Picatta which was so delicious and very well marinated and paired with some polenta cakes. Yum! I had the Caesar with NW Dungeness Crab, it was an incredible Caesar, not the most filling $32 salad of course, but both the crab and lettuce were the freshest I've ever had. The quality was definitely there. For Dessert, we did the Basil cake with jam and an Affogato. The Basil cake was probably my favorite part of the meal. Definitely a must order with that buttercream frosting on top! The ambiance was so great. We sat outside, which has a nice view of the water. Next time I definitely will be sitting at the beautiful bar so I can get a good view of the performance inside! The restaurant started to wind down a little after the first 30 minutes we were there, and it seemed like our food took extra long to come out, which was my only remark. The people who came 20 minutes after us received their food before we did and we were sitting there pretty hungry for a bit. Aside from that, will be coming back here to try some of their lovely pasta and other summer desserts. I have my eye on that Oreo cookie sundae!"
Jamie K.,5 star rating,"Jun 27, 2025","Would go back here in a heart beat! This place is beautiful. It's literally a pink door with no sign outside so if you have no idea what you are looking for good luck! I had found out about this place two days before we went and every reservation was taken. I waited and waited finally one came up. It was worth it, it was an 845 so it was amazing to watch the sunset with our seats. Idk how we got so lucky. All the food we had was 10/10. Nothing was less. We started with the ARANCINI rice balls. The sauce was incredible. CIOPPINO PINK DOOR had an amazing sauce that we ordered the fresh bread loaf to accompany it. Fresh northwest oysters were cold and as fresh as the day they are. Make sure you go stat!!!"
Grace K.,5 star rating,"Jul 1, 2025","This is definitely a must visit restaurant in Seattle. Make sure to book a reservation at least a month in advance. The restaurant is ginormous and well decorated with rustic chandeliers and mirrors. Our waitress was friendly and service was attentive. The bolognese was flavorful and robust and was paired well with perfectly cooked noodles. The lasagna pink door was a combination that I've never had before; however it was quite tasty and the pesto and marinara together was a wonderful pairing that made the dish quite special. The fries were perfectly fried and seasoned, and the fried whole garlic cloves and sage were delectable.  Only downside: good luck without a reservation and it's quite pricey. My diagnosis: a must-try high end Italian establishment in downtown town Seattle near / in Pike Place."
Roland H.,5 star rating,"Jun 28, 2025","Very good Italian food. Oysters, Fritto Misto, Proscuitto, Papardelle, ... all excellent. Nice wine selection. Top notch service from Stephano P. Small negative; I asked for my Copper River Salmon medium rare but it was cooked all the way through. Also, many of the service staff were rushing around with stern looks on their faces and stood at the bar for several minutes while the bartender (tall, thin) washed glasses only 1-2' away. Finally another bartender took my order. Didn't feel truly welcome until we were seated. I get it, the restaurant is extremely busy and you have to book a month+ out but don't be a victim of your own success. Overall was excellent and I highly recommend."
