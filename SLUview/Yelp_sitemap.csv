Definitely make reservations; even at 11:30 a.m. when they opened for lunch, the place was already bustling.

We started with a half carafe of crisp white wine while my husband enjoyed a local brew. The fritto misto was fresh and perfectly fried -- light, crunchy, and delicious. We followed with a large Caesar salad topped with seared prawns -- the portions were generous and the prawns were huge, tender, and full of flavor. The pasta vongole was equally impressive, loaded with clams and beautifully seasoned. Even though we shared everything, we still left absolutely full and happy.

The ambiance is quirky yet cozy, the service impeccable, and James along with the entire waitstaff made us feel so welcome. We absolutely loved everything about this place and can't wait to return!","Sep 25, 2025"

Located in historic Pike Place, this place is a literal hidden gem, intentionally so, in Post Alley. As the name suggests, the restaurant is behind a literal pink door with no big signs or flashy displays, like a speakeasy.
The food was good, slightly expensive which was expected, but reasonable. The lasagna was probably my favorite dish out of all. Sadly I didn't get to try any desserts, but I've heard a lot of good things about them, so I'll definitely be back again to try them.
All of the ingredients are sourced locally and are incredibly fresh which really elevate the dishes.
I actually think the reason why I loved this place was due to the ambiance. The outdoor patio is exceptional, with flowers and views of the water. I also went in the summer when the weather was good, so that definitely helped.
Overall, if you are located in the Seattle area, I'd recommend giving this place a try!","Sep 25, 2025"

Pasta was excellent and prices were reasonable.  Lots of seating.  Entryway was a little hard to find but I would rather again in a heartbeat.

Get the ragu.  So good.","Sep 23, 2025"
"1758857976-4","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Restaurants","Rebecca C.","5 star rating","A friend of mine recommended dining at The Pink Door while we were visiting Seattle. We didn't have reservations so we took a chance and they were able to accommodate a party of two just before the lunch rush. Our server was very friendly and let us take our time to decide what we wanted to order.

For our appetizer we ordered the caprese - pink door. It was a nice and refreshing dish with the tomatoes to start off with. We split the Tuscan fries and Linguini Alle Vongole. They were both outstanding! The linguini had lots of clams and a kick to it with the red pepper flakes. I highly recommend ordering this dish. The fries were delicious and had whole cloves of fried garlic. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. 

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and spacious with tall ceilings. I noticed they had some aerial equipment hanging on the wall and a stage. Turns out they have aerial shows. The entrance is not street level and there is no signage outside that says the name of the restaurant. We walked right by it the first time. Overall, the food and service was excellent and I will definitely come back the next time I visit Seattle.","Sep 21, 2025"

Food was amazing, we couldn't decide what to try so we tried a bunch of things!  Bread service was excellent, nice grassy EVOO infused with garlic and rosemary.  Started with the calamari.  So good surprising with shrimp, lemon, olives, calamari was delicious with light aioli.  We shared the clams/mussel dish. So good,
Mussels were huge, clams
Sweet and salty like eating the ocean.  We saved the bread from the bread service. The grilled ciabatta was good, but we enjoyed the fresh bread more,
 We also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (thinking about Nona here). The meatballs were not as tender as I like,
But the flavor was spot on.
 So much leftover food, but when you visit Seattle and are not sure you are coming back...brought home a piece of basil cake. Haven't tried it yet, still too full","Sep 17, 2025"

Vibes are super nice especially if you get a table facing the market. We got the lasagna and linguine this time around, although my all-time favorite item here has been one of their rotational risottos. The linguine is on the menu year round and is also certified broke da mouth! I preferred that over the lasagna, which is what they're known for. 
If you're wanting to stop by for dinner time, make sure to make rezzies ahead of time bc spots fill up QUICKLY.","Sep 10, 2025"
"1758857976-7","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Restaurants","Anjelica C.","4 star rating","Food - i think they have a rotating menu. so not too many options, but they change often. this was my first time there, so not that i know. this is my knowledge based on reddit. 

group of 4, we started with the caprese & the calamari. both really good. caprese was very fresh & the calamari had a good crunch and seasoning. the combo was a good idea because we had a little bit of fried & then the caprese to help us feel a little healthy. 

i had the risotto with corn. basically anything with corn i love. this was really good. the cook on the risotto was also good, not too mushy. 

service - good. they let us know they changed their bread policy (which you now have to pay for). came in and checked on us. and the food came out quickly. 

ambiance - i guess they have perfomances but we didn't catch any. otherwise the main dining room was pretty packed. there's also a patio but we didn't check it out. theres quirky paintings on the wall and a trapeze kind of swing. a stage where some (lucky or unlucky) people (based on your personality) had to sit. thankfully not us.","Sep 8, 2025"

Flavor and texture of the pastas were perfectly made. The sides are just as good to match. Highly recommend this spot.","Sep 18, 2025"
"1758857976-9","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Restaurants","Arthur E.","5 star rating","Went on a Saturday evening - was able to get reservations through Open Table a few days before.  Was seated at the lounge - the ambiance was a bit of a casual, but not super relaxed place.  The lounge has aerial acrobatics shows in the evening time - which was pretty neat.

For food, we ordered figs/prosciutto/goat cheese, lasagna, and garganelli.  The antipasto was delicious - figs were super sweet and done right.  The pastas were both very good, but also very rich and heavy - so no need to over-order.  We also had the tiramisu for dessert, which was good - but not amazing.  Also had a bottle of wine to go along with the meal.

Overall - a good meal for a special night out without breaking the bank - just make sure to sort out reservations ahead of time.","Sep 1, 2025"
"1758857976-10","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Restaurants","Steve S.","5 star rating","If you've never been, find a way to make a reservation! You arrive at an unassuming ""pink door"" in an alleyway, and it opens up to a beautiful sprawling restaurant with packed tables. The place is bustling with live music, views of the bay, rustic Italian food, and apparently, at times, cabaret and trapeze acts.

Already the immersion you get walking down from the entrance is an experience, but then it's quickly backed up by a delicious meal. The ingredients in our starter dishes were palpably fresh and felt locally grown. If you've never had a homegrown tomato, it's a whole other experience, especially when paired in a Caprese salad with freshly made mozzarella. The tuna crudo was also delicious, accompanied by a tangy vinaigrette and little salty accents from the olives and fried capers.

From the main dishes, I felt the pappardelle was surprisingly the runaway star. Feel free to let go of any snobbery you have about ordering pasta out when it's handmade like this. Each noodle was rolled so thin that you could practically see through it when held up. So delicate on the palate and accompanied by an earthy ragu sauce that had elements of carrot worked in. Amazing! There is always lots of rave about the Pink Door cioppino (seafood stew) and the lasagna. Unless you're a diehard seafood fan, I would favor a noodle dish over the cioppino, because these people know how to roll out their pasta dough.

Overall, landing a reservation in my estimation is challenging but worth the hype. Pro-tip: I found the restaurant opens a set of last-minute tables that you can snag same-day around 11am, so either camp out on the app or set an alert for available tables.","Aug 30, 2025"
